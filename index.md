### About me

I am a PhD candidate in biostatistics at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/epi-biostat-occh/academic-programs/grad/biostatistics) under the supervision of [Celia Greenwood](https://www.mcgill.ca/statisticalgenetics/people) and [Aur√©lie Labbe](http://www.hec.ca/en/profs/aurelie.labbe.html).  My main areas of research all fall in the realm of statistical genetics.  My thesis topic is network estimation in microbiome data.  I also have ample experience in the analysis of DNA methylation data, in particular, adjusting for cell type heterogeneity in epigenomewide association studies.
